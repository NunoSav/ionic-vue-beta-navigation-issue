# ionic-vue-beta-navigation-issue

The code is meant to reproduce a issue with @ionic/vue where you can only go back once and then `IonBackButton` is not visible.

To see this follow these steps:
1. Open App
2. Click on Device
3. Click on any of the `ListItem`s
4. Click on `IonBackButton` on top-left corner
5. Now the `IonBackButton` element is not visible
